#Juggluco Tasker Plugin

This Android App provides an interface between Juggluco and Tasker.
It converts the Glucodata broadcast from Juggluco to an event for Tasker.
This event can be used for Tasker profiles.

##Installation
Install the last released version and start it once. 
You will be asked to disable battery optimisation.

##Configuration
In Juggluco activate "Glucodata broadcast" in the settings menu.


If all works like expected you can create a new profile in Tasker and select as event the plugin Juggluco Tasker Plugin.
Now you can use the variables for anything you like to do with.
